Voice Assistant (First Ever Project!)
Hi! I’m Asad, and this was the very first project I ever uploaded to GitHub — a voice assistant I built when I was 15. It was my introduction to building something from scratch and seeing it do things — like talk back to me, search the web, and open apps. This project sparked my passion for tech and creating with code.
